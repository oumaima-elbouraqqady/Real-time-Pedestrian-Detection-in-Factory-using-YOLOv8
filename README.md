# Real time Pedestrian Detection in Factory using YOLOv8
This project focuses on enhancing workplace safety in industrial settings by automating the detection of deviations in pedestrian crosswalks. Leveraging advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), it aims to prevent overlaps between pedestrians and industrial vehicles.
Using a real-time object detection model like YOLO (You Only Look Once), the system identifies and alerts for any deviations from designated pedestrian paths. This ensures continuous adherence to safety standards, minimizes the risk of accidents, and strengthens existing prevention measures.
The solution autonomously monitors critical areas in real-time, offering an innovative approach to improving safety in production environments.
